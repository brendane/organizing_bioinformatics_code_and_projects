I put together this guide to organizing bioinformatics data, results,
and code on HPC systems for a colleague, and thought it might be useful
to others. Specifically, it is aimed at the Minnesota Supercomputing
Institute (MSI), but much of it applies to any system.

I wrote the guide using emacs org mode, then exported it to HTML, and
styled the HTML with the "bigblow" theme by Fabrice Neissen
(https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes). I also inlined all the
images, css, and javascript to make one html file using inliner
(https://github.com/remy/inliner).
